Explanation:
I have no idea how to fix the first error, and as it is in the base swift game code,
I am too afraid to touch it.
As to the rest, they are length violations in the level codes.  I can’t really think
of any way to shorten these files, and these warnings aren’t very serious, so I
am going to ignore them.
